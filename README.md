# Facial Expression recognition code snippet (not run)
This is just a code snippet touching all areas of image classification, from data preprocessing including gaussian blur 
to smoothen the noise from the small featured greyscale image.
It also utilizes the resnet pretrained model from pytorch.
In the training, the learning rate scheduler and the early stopping were implemented as well.
The same was sone for the custom CNN model architecture as the second model.
